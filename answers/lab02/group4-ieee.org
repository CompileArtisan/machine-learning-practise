This paper presents a methodology for analyzing seismic data from significant
earthquakes using the ObsPy Python library. We leverage the
\texttt{obspy.mass\_downloader() } module to efficiently retrieve waveform data
in miniSEED format and associated station metadata in StationXML format from
multiple data centers, including IRIS. Our dataset encompasses four major
seismic events: the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Japan), the 2010 Chile earthquake,
the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake (Japan), and the 2015 Nepal earthquake. Downloaded
miniSEED files are processed to extract relevant features. Specifically, we
convert the time-domain data into CSV files containing statistical measures such
as mean, standard deviation, maximum amplitude, peak-to-peak amplitude, root
mean square, dominant frequency, spectral centroid, energy, and the waveform
itself, along with station metadata including station ID, channel, start time,
latitude, longitude, elevation, and distance from the event. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of this processed data by applying the Short-Term
Average/Long-Term Average (STA/LTA) algorithm to the mean-subtracted waveforms
to automatically identify the arrival of P-Waves and S-Waves. This approach facilitates
efficient data acquisition, feature extraction, and automated phase picking for
large seismic datasets, enabling further analysis of earthquake dynamics.

* Introduction
# Some text with a citation [cite:@taylorgetting].
The analysis of seismic data provides crucial insights into earthquake dynamics
and Earth's subsurface structure. Various seismic waveform data from several
significant earthquakes were processed and analyzed by investigating the
relationship between maximum amplitude and distance to the event. This was done
by extracting features, using matrix operations and similarity measures. We
focus on four major seismic events: the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Japan), the 2010
Chile earthquake, the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake (Japan), and the 2015 Nepal
earthquake. This approach facilitates access to a large volume of data from
diverse sources.

* Methodology
The ObsPy Python library was used for efficient data acquisition and
manipulation. Using \texttt{obspy.mass\_downloader()}, we retrieved waveform data
in miniSEED format and corresponding station metadata in StationXML format from
multiple data centers, including IRIS. The downloaded miniSEED files were processed to extract key
features for analysis. Time-domain data was converted into CSV files and
statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, maximum amplitude,
peak-to-peak amplitude, root mean square, dominant frequency, spectral centroid
and energy were added to it. Crucially, station metadata,
including station ID, channel, start time, latitude, longitude, elevation, and
distance from the event, were also incorporated into the CSV files. This
enriched dataset allows for comprehensive analysis, linking waveform
characteristics with station location and event information.


* Literature Survey
Seismic signal processing and analysis have garnered significant attention in
recent years, with various machine learning methodologies being employed for
classification, event detection, and predictive modeling. This section reviews
key contributions in the field, highlighting different approaches and techniques
applied to seismic data analysis.


Li et al. \cite{b1} investigated seismic data
classification using supervised machine learning techniques. Their study focused
on extracting features such as spectral content, amplitude variations, and
waveform characteristics. They evaluated the performance of multiple machine
learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and
Neural Networks, which were trained on labeled seismic event datasets to assess
classification accuracy.


Ramirez and Meyer \cite{b2} explored seismic phase
classification through manifold learning techniques. Their approach involved
mapping high-dimensional seismic data onto a lower-dimensional manifold using
Laplacian Eigenmaps, improving classification performance by preserving local
waveform structures. Their method demonstrated enhanced differentiation between
P-waves and S-waves using nearest-neighbor-based classifiers in the transformed
space.


Chakraborty et al. \cite{b3} employed statistical feature extraction
techniques for micro-seismic event detection. The extracted features included
peak amplitude, energy, zero-crossing rate, and entropy. Machine learning models
such as Random Forest, SVM, and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were applied to
classify seismic events, distinguishing natural seismic activity from noise with
improved accuracy.


Shu et al. \cite{b4} conducted a comprehensive survey on
machine learning applications in microseismic signal recognition and
classification. They categorized methodologies into three major groups:
feature-based models utilizing statistical descriptors, deep learning models
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs), and hybrid techniques that integrate statistical feature extraction with
deep learning frameworks. Additionally, their survey highlighted key challenges
and potential advancements in the domain.


Varshney et al. \cite{b5} developed a
machine learning-based earthquake monitoring system leveraging real-time seismic
data streams. Their approach involved preprocessing seismic data using Fourier
and Wavelet Transforms before training classification models, such as Decision
Trees and Neural Networks, to detect and monitor earthquake events dynamically.


Chin et al. \cite{b6} enhanced earthquake detection accuracy by implementing a
hybrid deep learning model integrating CNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks. Their framework, trained on labeled seismic waveform datasets,
incorporated data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness. The
proposed system demonstrated superior detection performance compared to
traditional signal processing methods.


Shimshoni and Intrator \cite{b7} applied
ensemble learning techniques for seismic signal classification. Their work
utilized bagging and boosting strategies to enhance classification accuracy,
demonstrating that ensemble-based neural network approaches could improve
differentiation between seismic events.


Agliz and Atmani \cite{b8} employed
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for seismic signal classification.
Their methodology involved extracting both frequency-domain and time-domain
features from seismic waveforms, which were subsequently used as input to the
neural network for classification and training.


Akhouayri et al. \cite{b9}
introduced a fuzzy expert system for automatic seismic signal classification.
Their method defined fuzzy sets based on key signal parameters such as
amplitude, frequency content, and duration, allowing for a more flexible and
interpretable classification framework compared to traditional rule-based
systems.


Curilem et al. \cite{b10} investigated the application of genetic
algorithms for optimizing neural network classifiers in the context of volcanic
seismic signal classification. Their findings demonstrated that evolutionary
computation techniques could enhance the performance of neural network models in
differentiating between various types of volcanic seismic events.

* Results and Discussion
The rank of a matrix tells you the number of linearly independent columns
present in it. In the case of an observation matrix, each column corresponds to
a feature. Hence the rank is a measure of non-degenerateness.


Classification is a type of supervised machine learning which is used to predict
labels or catagories. As a dataset, you are given with various features, along
with the labels each data point is associated with. The output of a
classification model is a class label. You basically use this whenever you want
to assign an input some predefined category. Between each of the output classes,
there exists a clear decision boundary. There are many examples and types of
classification models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector
Machines and Neural Networks (for classification). The evaluation metrics used
for classification are Accuracy, Precision, Recall, \(F_{1}\)-score and ROC-AUC.


Regression is another type of supervised machine learning which is used to
predict continuous values. There are many examples and types for regression
models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, Neural
Networks (for regression). Regression don't have any strict decision boundary.
It tries to fit a line or a curve in the dataset, which illustrates the
predicted output for each input. The evaluation metrics used for regression are \(R^{2}\) score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE).
